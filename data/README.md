This directory contains all the data files used and generated by the AI Resume Tools application.

## Structure

- `resumes/` - Store your resume files (PDF, DOCX) here
- `job_descriptions/` - Store job description files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) here
- `output/` - Generated customized resumes and cover letters will be saved here

## Usage

When using the command-line interface, you'll reference files in these directories:

```
